# Critical Constraints

## DO NOT MODIFY These Directories (Auto-Generated from WikBot):
- `data/domain/data/` - Game data repositories
- `data/domain/enum/` - Game enumerations  
- `data/domain/model/` - TypeScript models

## Technology Requirements:
- Always use TypeScript for new code
- Use NextJS App Router architecture for new pages
- Use Yarn (never npm) for package management
- We are forced to use Grommet UI elements for the time being
- Follow the domain-driven design pattern in `data/domain/`

## Architecture Understanding:
- Each game system has its own domain class
- Data flow: Game save → Parse → Calculate cross-impacts → Display  
- Real-time Firebase integration for user data
- Complex post-processing pipeline for interdependent calculations
