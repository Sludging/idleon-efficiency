ALWAYS reference these key documentation files when working on this codebase:

- **`docs/CODEBASE_OVERVIEW.md`** - Technical architecture, constraints, development workflow, file structure, and external dependencies
- **`docs/NEW_FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`** - Step-by-step guide for implementing new game features, including prerequisites, tasks, and testing requirements

# Additional Info
- This is a reverse-engineering project for the idle MMO "Legends of Idleon"
- Game mechanics must be visually verified against the actual running game
- Never guess or assume game calculations - always verify
- Data sync from external WikBot project using: `cp -r ../IdleonWikiBot/exported/ts/* data/domain/`
