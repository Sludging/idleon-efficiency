# New Feature Implementation

**When implementing any new game feature, ALWAYS follow the comprehensive guide in `docs/NEW_FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`.**

## Required Prerequisites Before Starting:
- Gather all game data requirements (save file keys, resource storage locations)
- Confirm WikBot data availability or timeline  
- Identify similar existing features to model after
- Determine navigation placement and routing structure
- Get asset names and image locations from developer

## Implementation Process:
1. **Prerequisites verification** - Ensure all required information is available
2. **Domain implementation** - Follow similar feature patterns  
3. **Data pipeline integration** - Add to idleonData.tsx processing
4. **UI development** - Create components following existing patterns
5. **Navigation integration** - Update routing and navigation
6. **Testing implementation** - Add automated snapshot-based tests
7. **Visual validation** - Verify against actual game client

## When Working on Features:
1. Check if it involves any auto-generated files (don't modify them)
2. Understand which game system/world the feature belongs to
3. Follow the established domain pattern
4. **ALWAYS add appropriate tests (see Testing Requirements)**
5. Plan for visual verification against the game
6. Consider cross-system impacts in calculations

**Refer to the complete implementation guide for detailed steps, templates, and examples.**
