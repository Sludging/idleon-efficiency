## Disclaimer

This project, for lack of a better word, a mess. It's over a year of me learning TypeScript + React + Front end programming over a period of time. It has various different patterns intermixed as I learned different things over time, it has decisions I'm not proud of or happy with and it has a mountain of tech-debt. 

Don't use this project as a learning opportunity.

## Notable contributors

This project (and the entire `data/domain/data` + `data/domain/model` folders) would likely not exist without the help of [BigCoight](https://github.com/BigCoight) the creator and owner of the bot that powers the Idleon Wiki.

Special shoutout as well to [Corbeno](https://github.com/Corbeno) for his contributions while this repository was private.
